Output Directory Information

1. Purpose of Directory Structure
This directory is designed to store all outputs generated by the Python and R scripts provided in this repository. To maintain organized results, the following sub-directories have been established:

- figures/: Stores all publication-ready visualizations, including ROC curves, SHAP summary plots, and confusion matrices.
- models/: Stores trained machine learning models, specifically CatBoost (.cbm) files and caret (.rds) files.
- results/: Stores statistical summaries, performance metrics (AUC, Accuracy, etc.), and feature selection reports in .csv or .xlsx format.

2. Note on Missing Files
To protect the intellectual property of the pending publication and comply with institutional data security policies, the specific result files and trained models are not included in this public repository at this stage.

3. Reproducibility
The directory structure is preserved using .gitkeep files. Users can fully reproduce the results and populate these folders by:
1. Setting up the environment as specified in the root requirements.txt.
2. Providing valid input data in the data/ directory.
3. Executing the scripts in the scripts_python/ and scripts_R/ directories in the recommended order.
